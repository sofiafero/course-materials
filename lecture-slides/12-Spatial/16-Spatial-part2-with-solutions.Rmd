# Preliminaries

Set your working directory (in your console) to the location of this file. E.g.:
```{r, eval=F}
setwd("C:/git/491/course-materials/lecture-slides/16-Spatial")
```

Run this (from Part 1):
```{r, results = "hide"}
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(tmap)
counties = st_read("data/california_counties/CaliforniaCounties.shp") |>
  st_make_valid()
alameda = counties |> filter(NAME == "Alameda")
```

# Spatial queries

---

# Types of spatial queries

**Spatial measurement**
- Returns a continuous numerical answer.
- **Length:** What is the length of I-90 in Montana?
- **Area:** What is the area of Gallatin County?
- **Distance:** What is the distance between Bozeman and Livingston?

**Spatial relationships**
- Returns TRUE or FALSE, or the set of matching features.
- **Intersect:** What states is Yellowstone National Park in?
- **Within:** Is the city of Bozeman entirely within Gallatin County?
- **Cross:** What counties does the Madison River pass through?

---

# Calculate area

```{r}
st_area(alameda)
```

Too big!

--

```{r}
st_area(alameda)/1000000
```

Wait, the units are wrong!

--

```{r}
library(units)
set_units(st_area(alameda), km^2)
```

---

# Calculate area

For all counties (add as new column/attribute):
```{r}
counties2 = counties |>
  cbind(area = set_units(st_area(counties), km^2))
mean(counties2$area)
```

---

# Calculate area

Spatial measurements can differ greatly depending on the CRS.
```{r}
# Calculate area using data in WGS84 CRS (4326)
counties2$area_wgs84 = set_units(st_area(st_transform(counties, 4326)), km^2)

# Calculate area using data in Web Mercator CRS (3857)
counties2$area_web = set_units(st_area(st_transform(counties, 3857)), km^2)

# Take a look at the results
counties2 |> select(starts_with("area")) |> head()
```

---

# Calculate area

Of these:
* Albers is an equal area CRS optimized for CA, so area measurements will be highly accurate.
* WGS84 is a geographic (unprojected) CRS in degrees... but `sf` calculates area using spherical geometry!
* Web Mercator is terrible! Preserves shape, but area is highly distorted.

**Your choice of CRS is absolutely critical to accurate calculations.**

---

# Calculate distance

Load BART rapid transit stations:
```{r}
stations = st_read("data/bart_stations_2019.geojson")
```

Calculate distance from each station to the Oakland Airport:
```{r}
st_distance(filter(stations, station_na == "Oakland Airport"), stations)
```


---
class: inverse, middle
name: subsets

# Spatial subsetting

---

# Spatial subsetting

Often we want to **subset** (i.e., filter) features according to their spatial relationship with another set of features. Types of relationships (queries that are either `TRUE` or `FALSE`):

.pull-left[
![](img/spatial_relationships.png)
]
.pull-right[
Common `sf` functions:
* `st_intersects` (most general)
* `st_within`
* `st_contains` (the inverse of `st_within`)
]

These functions are **binary predicates** that return matrices of `TRUE` and `FALSE` for all permutations of features in two shapefiles. They are most useful in combination with `st_filter`.

---

# Within vs. intersect

Load a shapefile of protected areas:
```{r}
protected = st_read("data/protected_areas/CPAD_2020a_units.shp")

# Verify CRS is the same as county
stopifnot(st_crs(protected) == st_crs(alameda))
```

---

# Within vs. intersect

Map them (takes a minute):
```{r, fig.height=3.5}
tm_shape(alameda) + tm_polygons() +
  tm_shape(protected) + tm_polygons(col = "green")
```

---

# Within vs. intersect

Some protected areas are completely **within** the county, some **overlap**, and some are completely **outside**.
* `st_intersects` returns both the "within" and "overlap" cases.
* `st_within` returns only the "completely within" cases.

Select the protected areas matching each of these criteria:
```{r}
protected_intersect = st_filter(protected, alameda) # default: st_intersects
protected_within = st_filter(protected, alameda, .predicate = st_within)

# Alternative syntax using [column, row] subsetting:
# protected_within = protected[alameda, , op = st_within]
```

---

# Within vs. intersect

Map them:
```{r, fig.height=3.3}
tm_shape(alameda) + tm_polygons(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_shape(protected_intersect) + tm_polygons(col = "green", alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_shape(protected_within) + tm_polygons(col = "blue", alpha = 0.5)
```

---

# Challenge

**Map only the BART stations that are within Alameda County.**  
Make them nice big dots with a fun color. (Hint: use `tm_dots()`.)

--

```{r, fig.height=2.75}
stations_alameda = stations |>
  st_transform(st_crs(alameda)) |>
  st_filter(alameda)
tm_shape(alameda) + tm_polygons(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_shape(stations_alameda) + tm_dots(col = "purple", size = 0.2)
```


---
class: inverse, middle
name: geometry

# Geometry operations

---

# Intersections

What if we want only the parts of the protected areas that fall within the county?
* Now we aren't just *selecting* features; we're *manipulating* their geometry.

We need a different spatial operation: `st_intersection`.
* It returns a new set of features that are **clipped** to the boundary of the county.

```{r}
protected_intersection = st_intersection(protected, alameda)
```

---

# Intersect vs. intersection

```{r, fig.height=3.7}
tm_shape(alameda) + tm_polygons() +
  tm_shape(protected_intersect) + tm_polygons(col = "green", alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_shape(protected_intersection) + tm_polygons(col = "red", alpha = 0.5)
```

---

# Intersections

Check the resulting object:

```{r}
table(protected_intersection$COUNTY)
```

Whoops! What went wrong?

---

# Intersections

.scroll-output-full[
```{r}
str(protected_intersection)
```
]

---

# Intersections

`st_intersection` returns attributes from **both** intersecting features.
* Mindlessly, without checking whether they still makes sense for the *intersection* geometry.
* For example, `ACRES` describes the area of the original, full protected area -- not only the part that is in Alameda County.

--

**Be careful when interpreting attributes after geometry operations.**

---

# Other geometry operations

![](img/geometry_operations.png)

---

# Challenge

**Combine these Southern California counties into one shape and map it:** Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego.

You should get this:

```{r, fig.height=3.5, echo = F}
county_list = c("Los Angeles", "Orange", "San Diego")
socal = counties |>
  filter(NAME %in% county_list) |>
  st_union()
tm_shape(socal) + tm_polygons(col = "yellow", alpha = 0.5)
```


---

# Challenge

**Combine these Southern California counties into one shape and map it:** Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego.

```{r, fig.height=2.5}
county_list = c("Los Angeles", "Orange", "San Diego")
socal = counties |>
  filter(NAME %in% county_list) |>
  st_union()
tm_shape(socal) + tm_polygons(col = "yellow", alpha = 0.5)
```

---

# Centroids

The **geographic centroid** of a polygon is its "center of gravity".
* A way to create a point representation of a more complex object.

```{r, fig.height=3}
county_centroids = st_centroid(counties)
tm_shape(counties) + tm_borders() +
  tm_shape(county_centroids) + tm_dots(col = "red")
```

---

# Buffering

**How many protected areas are within walking distance of a BART station?** Let's say walking distance is 1 km, or about 0.6 miles.

First, **buffer** the BART stations:
```{r, fig.height=2.7}
stations_1km = st_buffer(stations, dist = 1000)  # in the CRS's length units
tm_shape(stations_1km) + tm_polygons(col = "pink") +
  tm_shape(stations) + tm_dots()
```

---

# Buffering

Now, we can subset the protected areas by whether they intersect one of these buffer polygons.
```{r, error=TRUE}
protected_transit = st_filter(protected, stations_1km)
```

Oops... we forgot to put them in the same CRS.

---

# Buffering

```{r, fig.height=3.6}
stations_1km_proj = st_transform(stations_1km, st_crs(protected))
protected_transit = st_filter(protected, stations_1km_proj)
tm_shape(stations_1km) + tm_polygons(col = "pink") +
  tm_shape(protected_transit) + tm_polygons(col = "green", alpha = 0.4)
```

---

# Challenge

**What fraction of the area of Alameda County is within 2 km of a BART station?**

Hint: Make a step-by-step plan before you begin.

--

Plan -

1. Buffer all BART stations by 2000 m (not just the ones in Alameda County)
2. Intersect these buffers with Alameda County
3. Union the remaining buffers (to avoid double-counting areas near multiple stations)
4. Calculate the area of this union (in an equal-area projected CRS)
5. Calculate the area of Alameda County (same)

Map the result after each step to make sure you got what you expected.

---

# Challenge

**What fraction of the area of Alameda County is within 2 km of a BART station?**

1\. Buffer all BART stations by 2000 m
```{r, fig.height=3}
stations_2km = st_buffer(stations, dist = 2000)
qtm(stations_2km)
```

---

# Challenge

**What fraction of the area of Alameda County is within 2 km of a BART station?**

2\. Intersect these buffers with Alameda County
```{r, fig.height=3}
stations_2km_proj = st_transform(stations_2km, st_crs(alameda))
stations_2km_alameda = st_intersection(stations_2km_proj, alameda)
qtm(stations_2km_alameda)
```

---

# Challenge

**What fraction of the area of Alameda County is within 2 km of a BART station?**

3\. Union the remaining buffers (to avoid double-counting areas near multiple stations)
```{r, fig.height=3}
union_buffers = st_union(stations_2km_alameda)
tm_shape(alameda) + tm_polygons(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_shape(union_buffers) + tm_polygons(col = "skyblue", alpha = 0.5)
```

---

# Challenge

**What fraction of the area of Alameda County is within 2 km of a BART station?**

4\. Calculate the area of this union (in an equal-area projected CRS)
```{r}
crs_albers = st_crs(alameda)
stopifnot(st_crs(union_buffers) == crs_albers)
area_near_transit = set_units(st_area(union_buffers), km^2)
area_near_transit
```

5\. Calculate the area of Alameda County (same)
```{r}
area_county = set_units(st_area(alameda), km^2)
area_county
```

---

# Challenge

**What fraction of the area of Alameda County is within 2 km of a BART station?**

Putting it all together and writing as one pipeline:
```{r}
area_near_transit = stations |>
  st_buffer(dist = 2000) |>
  st_transform(st_crs(alameda)) |>
  st_intersection(alameda) |>
  st_union() |>
  st_area()
area_near_transit / st_area(alameda)
```

So about 11%.

# Spatial joins

---

# Spatial joins

**Spatial joins** let us conduct graphical, statistical, or econometric analysis on variables that are originally at different levels of spatial aggregation.

**Are parent incomes predictive of school academic performance?**

What data would you ideally want to answer this question?

--

What we have:
* By school: academic performance index (API), location.
* By Census tract: median household income, tract boundary.

How can we link this data for an imperfect approximation?

---

# Spatial joins

Load the data:
```{r}
tracts = st_read("data/census/tracts_acs_sdf_ac.json")
schools = read_csv("data/alco_schools.csv")
```

---

# Spatial joins

Look at the data:
.medsmall[
```{r}
colnames(tracts)
head(schools)
```
]

---

# Spatial joins

The schools dataset is just a csv, not a shapefile / feature collection.
* But it does have lat/lon coordinates, from which we can create a point layer.

Convert to an `sf` object. (GCS is unknown, but fine to assume it's WGS84.)
```{r}
wgs84 = 4326
schools = read_csv("data/alco_schools.csv") |>
  st_as_sf(coords = c("X", "Y"), crs = wgs84)
colnames(schools)
```

---

# Spatial joins

Let's see where the schools are in relation to the Census tracts:
```{r, fig.height=3.5}
tm_shape(tracts) + tm_polygons(col = "skyblue") +
  tm_shape(schools) + tm_dots(col = "navy")
```

---

# Spatial joins

We want to join the tract data to the schools data. Normally we look for a common variable.
```{r}
colnames(schools)
colnames(tracts)
```

--

**But there are no variables in common!** (What if the schools dataset identified the county?) 
--
Still a bad idea -- we would throw away more detailed information.

---

# Spatial joins

Instead, we need to perform a join using spatial relationships -- a **spatial join**.

First, check the CRS:

.scroll-output-full[
```{r}
st_crs(schools)
st_crs(tracts)
```
]

---

# Spatial joins

Put them in the same CRS, then do a spatial join:
```{r}
schools_nad83 = st_transform(schools, st_crs(tracts))
schools_tract = st_join(schools_nad83, tracts)
View(schools_tract)
colnames(schools_tract)
```

Now we know the neighborhood household income for each school!

--
* Is this what we wanted?

---

# Checking our output

**Good questions to ask after any operation:**
1. What type of object should we have gotten?
2. What should the dimensions of that object be, and why?
3. How can we visually check the results?

---

# Checking our output

```{r, out.height="80%", out.width="100%"}
tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(tracts) + tm_polygons(col = 'white', border.col = 'black') +
  tm_shape(schools_tract) + tm_dots(col = 'GEOID')
```

---

# Spatial joins

Finally, we can look at a scatterplot of the relationship we wanted:
```{r, out.width="80%", fig.height=4.5}
ggplot(schools_tract, aes(x = med_hhinc, y = API)) + geom_point()
```

---

# Spatial joins

Removing the zeros (probably missing data) and add a flexibly-estimated CEF:
```{r, out.width="80%", fig.height=4.2}
schools_tract |>
  filter(API > 0) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = med_hhinc, y = API)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```

---

# Challenge

**What fraction of the population of Alameda County has a BART station in their Census tract?** (Hint: `c_race` is total population.)

--

Plan -

1. Spatial join BART stations to Census tracts.
2. Sum the population of these tracts.
3. Compare it to total population.

---

# Challenge

**What fraction of the population of Alameda County has a BART station in their Census tract?** (Hint: `c_race` is total population.)

```{r}
# Spatial join stations to tracts
tracts2 = tracts |>
  st_transform(st_crs(stations)) |>
  st_join(stations)
stopifnot(nrow(tracts2) == nrow(tracts))

# Sum population by whether a tract has a station
tracts3 = tracts2 |>
  st_drop_geometry() |>
  mutate(has_station = as.integer(!is.na(objectid))) |>
  rename(population = c_race)
summarize(tracts3, population = sum(population), .by = has_station)
sum(filter(tracts3, has_station==1)$population) / sum(tracts3$population)
```


---

# Challenge

But Census tracts don't really correspond to anything meaningful in people's daily lives. Maybe what we really want to know is:

**What fraction of the population of Alameda County is within 2 km of a BART station?**

You can't do this perfectly. Try to find the least bad way, and state what assumptions you're making.

--

One simple plan: (inaccurate)
1. Find the Census tracts that intersect the unioned station buffers.
2. Calculate the population of these tracts.
3. Compare it to total population. (Assumption: The entire population of each tract lives within the station buffers.)

---

# Challenge

**What fraction of the population of Alameda County is within 2 km of a BART station?**

```{r, fig.height=3}
# Intersect Census tracts with unioned station buffers
tracts_near_transit = tracts |>
  st_transform(st_crs(union_buffers)) |> 
  st_intersection(union_buffers)
# Calculate population of these tracts
(pop_near_transit = sum(tracts_near_transit$c_race))
# Calculate fraction of total population
(pop_total = sum(tracts$c_race))
pop_near_transit / pop_total
```

But this is an upper bound (overestimate) of the true answer.


---

# Challenge

**What fraction of the population of Alameda County is within 2 km of a BART station?**

Another plan: (more accurate but imperfect)

1. Get the portions of Census tracts that intersect the unioned station buffers.

2. Calculate the fraction of each Census tract that falls within these buffers.
<ol type='a'>
<li>Union intersections within each Census tract.</li>
<li>Calculate the areas of the intersections.</li>
<li>Calculate the areas of the Census tracts.</li>
<li>(Spatial) join intersections to Census tracts.</li>
</ol>

3. Calculate the population of each Census tract within buffers. (Assumption: Population density is uniform within each Census tract.)

4. Sum population within buffers, and in total.
